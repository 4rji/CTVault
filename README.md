# CTVault

A local, cryptographically verified Certificate Transparency research archive.
Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-ctvault-design.md`.

**Status:** Plan 1 (Foundations). You can create a vault on a dedicated ext4
volume, pin CT logs from Chrome's log list and verify a log's live signed tree
head. Ingestion arrives in Plan 2.

## Requirements

- Linux, with the vault on a dedicated, mounted **ext4** volume (an external
  SSD). xfs, btrfs and f2fs work only with `--allow-untested-fs`; exFAT, NTFS,
  FAT, FUSE, network filesystems and tmpfs are always rejected.
- Go 1.26.8 or newer. With the default `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`, an older `go`
  downloads the right toolchain automatically.

## Build and test

```bash
go build -o ctvault ./cmd/ctvault
go test -race ./...
```

## Usage

```bash
# The SSD must be mounted at /mnt/ctvault and contain nothing but lost+found.
./ctvault init /mnt/ctvault
export CTVAULT_ROOT=/mnt/ctvault

./ctvault logs list --available        # RFC 6962 logs in Chrome's log list
./ctvault logs add argon2027h1          # pin the log and its public key
./ctvault logs info argon2027h1         # fetch and verify the live signed tree head
./ctvault vault add-dir /mnt/disk2/ctvault-vault   # optional extra vault disk
```

Exit codes: 0 OK, 1 error, 2 usage, 3 disk cap reached, 4 volume check failed,
5 verification or corruption failure.
